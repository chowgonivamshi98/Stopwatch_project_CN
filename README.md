# Stopwatch Project
* Creating Stopwatch  using HTML CSS, and JavaScript.
* Our StopWatch will have the functionality of Start, Stop, and Reset.
## Approach :
* Create div container in which all the elements are present.
* Inside this container add another div  that contain all time elements like an  minutes, seconds, and milliseconds, 3 buttons for start, stop, and reset.
* Now  add a External  Css file to Style the document.
* Now add a JavaScript file in which add onclick functions on all three buttons and create another function in which write all the logical code and add value to corresponding minutes, seconds, milliseconds.
